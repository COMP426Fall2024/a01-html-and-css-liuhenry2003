                The punishment of Prometheus for stealing fire from Olympus and giving it to humans is a subject of both 
                ancient and modern culture. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, condemned Prometheus to eternal torment for his 
                transgression. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle—the emblem of Zeus—was sent to eat his liver 
                (in ancient Greece, the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions). His liver would then grow back overnight, 
                only to be eaten again the next day in an ongoing cycle. According to several major versions of the myth, 
                most notably that of Hesiod, Prometheus was eventually freed by the hero Heracles. In yet more symbolism, 
                the struggle of Prometheus is located by some at Mount Elbrus or at Mount Kazbek, two volcanic promontories in the 
                Caucasus Mountains beyond which for the ancient Greeks lay the realm of the barbari.</p>
